## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Javier Lougedo Lorente. I've studied Computer Science in the UAM, in Madrid, Spain, and now I'm looking forward to enlarge my knowledge in **computers**, their **software** and enrich my **programming** skills, by taking some EDX courses and learning by myself.

<!--## Languages I've used so far
Till the moment, I've programmed in various languages, such as **C**, **Java**, **Python**, **LISP**; I've made various websites and have a good touch on ofimatics as well. 

**Lougedo/Lougedo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
